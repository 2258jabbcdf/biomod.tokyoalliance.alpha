        <h1>DESIGN</h1>

        <div class="concept">
            <h2>〇 Concept</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                "DNA Mochi Device" we design envisions a DNA device whose gelation is controlled by the input-DNA and whose function is programmed by sequence.
                We believed that the long-stranded DNA product by RCA is the key to achieving this design.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="previous">
            <h2>〇 Previous Study</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                In designing a device to fulfill our concept, we consulted two previous studies on RCA.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                The first is that Origami structures were formed by adding staple DNA to RCA products(1). RCA products produced using 96-nt single-stranded circular DNA as a template,
                 i.e., long single-stranded DNA with repeating 96-nt sequences, and 16-nt and 32-nt staples by adding two of each type, for a total of four types,
                 they have succeeded in forming a wire structure according to the design principle of DNA Origami. 
                <br>
                &emsp;
                The second is about a DNA gel that was constructed by mixing two different RCA products, connecting them to each other and trapping specific cells(2).
                In this paper, by inserting DNA sequences that are complementary to each other into the two types of RCA products,
                they recognize and bind to each other and form a DNA gel by increasing their concentration through the multivalency effect.
                By introducing a DNA aptamer sequence that binds specifically to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSA), BMSA are incorporated into the DNA gel in the process formed gel by the agglomeration of RCA products. 
                This reportedly allowed for the segregation of BMSA from other cells.
                </p>
            <ul>
                
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="our">
            <h2>〇 Our Device</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                By adding a toe-hold sequence for strand displacement to the staple DNA for folding RCA-produced long-stranded DNA to Origami-like structure,
                we aim to design toward a device in which the staple DNA is dislodged when certain DNA is present and the free long-stranded DNA self-aggregates with each other. 
                We designed two RCA products with complementary sequences that recognize each other, bind, and aggregate together to allow folding to Origami-like structure, and extended the toehold sequence to the stapled DNA.

            <p>
                &emsp;
                First, we show the sequence of the RCA template, primers, and staple that achieved folding to Origami-like structure in the previous study.

            <h2>〇 Designing Toehold with 1st RCA Staple</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                We designed our first device by citing RCA template and staple sequences that were confirmed folding to Origami-like structure from previous studies and adding toehold sequences to the staple DNA.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                We designed it using NUPACK, which is software for the analysis and design of nucleic acid structures. Therefore, it does not support DNA Origami structures, and the above structure could not be input as is.
                Thus, we calculated toehold sequences that do not interfere with the formation of secondary structures between the RCA product long-stranded DNA and staples by subdividing the elements with a focus on each staple. 
                Specifically, the subdivisions shown in the figure below were performed and calculated for other staples. In other words, we assumed a situation where four structures exist in one pot and optimized their stability.

            <h2>〇 Designing 2nd RCA Template and Staple</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                Referring to the other previous study, we considered a second RCA template that specifically binds to and gels with the first RCA product and can be Origami-like structure in the same manner as the first RCA product.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                First, we considered for a recognition sequence that is complementary to the first RCA product. In the paper, gelation of two 92nt RCA products had been performed, and in this case, the complementary sequences were 37nt each in both products. 
                In these sequences for gelation in previous study, the GC content was 50% and Tm was 68°C. Therefore, partial sequences like these conditions were searched from existing RCA templates and determined as follows.
            </p>

            <div class="sequence">
                <p>
                    ACTCGTATTCTCAACTCGTCTCTGCCCTGACT 
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                This sequence spans three staples at the time of Origami-like structure and has a sequence length of 32nt, a GC content of 50%, and a Tm of 66℃.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                We then designed the undetermined portion of the second RCA template and the staple DNA with toe-hold domain in NUPACK, just as we calculated the toe-hold sequence in the first device. 
                In this case, we set up a situation in which there was also an RCA device in one tube that had been designed based on previous studies, and the concentration of the newly designed RCA device was more than that of the first device. 
                The reason for this is, first, to design a sequence that does not interfere with the structure formation of the first sequence, and second, because the RCA is a reaction that repeatedly amplifies the same sequence, 
                it is not easy to cause self-aggregation when present at high concentrations.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                The following are the RCA template and primer sequences obtained here.
            </p>
            <div class="sequence">

            </div>

            <h2>〇 Redesigning Toehold with 2nd RCA Staple</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                For the second RCA product, we redesigned the toehold sequence to be attached to the staple. Although we had already calculated the toe-hold sequence in the previous design, we performed the calculation again with the same concentration of RCA product Origami 1 and RCA product Origami 2. 
                This is because the purpose of the toehold sequence is to promote strand displacement and subsequent gelation, so we rethought that it is appropriate to assume that the two types of devices are present at the same concentration for the reaction conditions.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                The following is the designed toehold staple sequence.
