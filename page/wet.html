        <h1>EXPERIMENT: WET</h1>
        <h2><b>●Conducting Rolling Circle Amplification and Confirming Results</b></h2>
        As a first experiment, we conducted Rolling Circle Amplification using a 
            template which has a reference sequence. (The method is based on reference[1])
        
        <h3>1, Preparation of Circularized Template</h3>
        The circularized template was prepared for use in the RCA.
<p>○Ligation</p>
Template DNA (linear state)was formed into a circularized template by connecting template DNA with a splint DNA.  
<br>
<br>Firstly, we annealed template DNA and splint DNA in the mixture according to the following chart.

<br>
<br>The mixture was heated to 95 degrees C for 1 min and cooled slowly to room temperature over 1h.
<br>
<br>After cooling, to connect each end of template DNA by ligation, 6uL of T4 DNA ligase(350 U/uL) was added and the mixture was incubated at 16 degrees C for 16h, and finally inactivated at 65 degrees C for 20 min.
(T4 DNA ligase was purchased from Takara)
<br>
<br>Following the ligation and inactivation, to remove splint DNA from the circlarized template, exonuclease I and exonuclease I buffer were added into the mixture according to an under chart.
(exonuclease I and exonuclease I buffer were purchased from Takara)

<br>
<br>After adding, the mixture was incubated at 25 degrees C for 2h, and ended with inactivation at 65 degrees C for 20 min.
<br>
<br>Next, the circularized template was purified by Phenol-Chloroform abstraction （Phenol：Chloroform：Isoamyl alcohol=25：25：1(vol), then ethanol precipitation.
<br>
<br>Finally, the purified circularized template was redissolved in 50uL of TE buffer (10mM tris-HCL, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0).
<br>
<h3>2, Rolling-Circle-Amplification </h3>
        RCA was carried out in the mixture containing substances under the chart.
<br>・Adjustments are made on ice.
<br>・Phi29 DNA polymerase, TE buffer, and Recombinant Albumin were purchased from New England Biolabs.

<br>
<br>RCA was carried out for 8 hours at 30 degrees C in Thermal Cycler.
<br>
<br>After RCA, the RCA Products(RCA-amplified long ssDNA) was purified by Phenol-Chloroform abstraction （Phenol：Chloroform：Isoamyl alcohol=25：25：1(vol), then ethanol precipitation.
Then, the Purified RCA Products was redissolved in 100uL TE buffer (10mM tris-HCL, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0).
<br>
<h3>Measuring the Mass Concentration of RCA Products</h3>
        After purifying, we  measured the mass concentration(ng/uL) of RCA Products 
        by DeNovix spectrophotometer (SCRUM Inc.) and result is <b>1918.341ng/uL</b>
