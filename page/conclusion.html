            We have accomplished up to the second of six steps.

            <ol>
                1. Design:
                <br>
                &emsp;
                Design an RCA template that can be used for both folding to Origami-like structure and Gelation with reference to previous studies.

                2. RCA:
                <br>
                &emsp;
                Perform RCA using the designed template and confirm that long-stranded DNA is produced.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                3. folding to Origami:
                <br>
                &emsp;
                Using the RCA product long-stranded DNA, confirm that folding to Origami-like structure.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                4. Chain displacement:
                <br>
                &emsp;
                Confirm the RCA product folded to Origami-like structure to be single stranded by strand displacement.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                5. Gelation:
                <br>
                &emsp;
                Using the RCA product long-stranded DNA, confirm gelation.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                6. Assaying a Series reactions:
                <br>
                &emsp;
                Confirm the change from the Origami-like structure to the Gel structure by following the workflow. (Completion of device!)

        <p>
            <br>
            &emsp;
            One of the reasons for the deadlock in the third stage, was that we could not set up a system that could fully reproduce the conditions of the previous study(1) within the time frame of the BIO-MOD project, 
            and the cost was not sufficient to study the new conditions on top of that.

            <h2>〇 Near Future</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                Since we were unable to confirm the origamiｰlike structure folding of the RCA product and the release of long-stranded DNA by strand displacement reaction during BIOMOD period. 
                The next step for this project is to reevaluate the behavior of the current design. If there is still no improvement, we will need to revise the design. Once structure folding and gelation are confirmed, 
                we would confirm input-dependent gelation next. This is the goal of our project.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                As an extension of the project, we consider that designing sensors and processors with our device as actuator. This would allow for more precise behavior, increased sensitivity, and expansion to include calculations using signal DNA, etc.

        <div class="application">
            <h2>〇 Application</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                Future developments based on the features of this device include trap and release of specific substances, formation of reaction fields, and their medical technology applications called vascular embolization. This device, 
                which releases long-stranded DNA in an input-dependent manner, can recognize and aggregate itself or same type device to form a localized gel. By utilizing aptamer sequences, as pointed out in the Background section, 
                it is possible to incorporate molecules, compounds, and cells more selectively into the gel.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                For example, in addition to trapping specific cells while distinguishing between them and others, as has been accomplished in previous studies, it would be possible to form gels of a size that matches the concentration of the target or input DNA from the target 
                if there is an enough amount of this device. In other words, when there are few trapping targets, small gels are formed, and when there are many trapping targets, large gels are formed. Therefore, it is possible to control the size of the gel so that it does not take in more than necessary other things than the target.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                Such input-dependent properties can also be useful for agglomerating and holding any substance. In other words, it could be applied to controlling the reaction field. This is true with respect to ordinary chemical reactions, but it is more advantageous in cell-free transcription and translation, which is the inherent strength of DNA gels. 
                By incorporating gene sequences into the long-strand DNA that is released from the Origami-like structure and forms the gel, it is possible to create a device that might be enable to induce multiple reactions efficiently and continuously, such as forming a reaction field, controlling transcription and translation, and activating the expressed protein.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                Finally, as a more advanced application, we will suggest the application to vascular embolization(2). There exists a medical treatment taken against cancer cells, which aims to embolize blood vessels around cancer by administering a drug into the hepatic artery using a catheter and prevent nutrient supply to cancer cells by administering a drug into the hepatic artery using a catheter. 
                Referring to this, the proposed application is to prevent metastasis by inhibiting the spread of cancer cells rooted in capillaries into the bloodstream(3)(4), through local gel formation of this device and selective trapping by an aptamer sequence. 
                Cancer cells are known to release microRNAs (miRNAs) specific to their surroundings. By setting this miRNA as an input for this device, the behavior is achieved. In addition to aptamer sequences, it would also be possible to code for genes to enable active treatment.
